Hello! I'm Evan and if you're reading this, you might be thinking about hiring me.
Have a look through this project, and be sure to check out [cms_etl](../../../cms_etl), a select portion
of a menu-driven command line environment written in Python that I created to expedite some ETL operations
for a client. 

Thank you for your consideration!

## Project Context

This was a speed-run build (Squarespace was expiring in days and I did *not* want to pay another $250/yr)
using an HTML5UP.net design as visual inspiration.

It was built in Next.js over the course of a day and a half.

All components are from-scratch. 
- Zero component libraries were used: there are no dependencies beyond Tailwind.
- Hosted on AWS Lambda / S3 / Route 53 / etc via SST
  - (opted for SSR instead of static deployment to support future features like Etsy integrations)
- Reactive design scales to view widths as small as 250px
